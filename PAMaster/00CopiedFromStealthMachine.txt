Take existing PAP from Stealth machine and begin to merge with working PAG code.
PAP code is not working at the moment on Stealth.

Remove vChannel initialization from top level initialization as 3d element and 
put the code into the client connection. 

Then all critical sections/linked lists
will have the same name in PAG and PAP.
