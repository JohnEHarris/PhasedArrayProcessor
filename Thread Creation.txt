Server thread creation;

1. Listening socket Accepts a connection in OnAccept
2. OnAccept creates a new ST_SERVERS_CLIENT_CONNECTION() structure
3. OnAccept then creates a ServerSocketOwnerThread

4. If ServerSocketOwnerThread is created, it 
   creates a permanent serversocket and attaches it to the ServerSocketOwnerThread

5. ServerSocketOwnerThread creates the ServerRcvListThread
6. ServerRcvListThread creates a hwtimer if it is in the PhasedArrayProcessor (PAP) system


Linked lists and critical sections are created by the 
ServerConnectionManagement constructor so they do not have to be destroyed until 
the application closes.

7. Virtual channels are created in OnAcceptInitializeConnectionStats() called from
  Listening socket OnAccept()
